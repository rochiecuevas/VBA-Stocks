## Introduction
The multi-year stock data contains daily information on stock volume, opening and closing values, and the highest and lowest values. The MS Excel workbook contains stock data for three years: 2014, 2015, and 2016. the object of the study was to summarise the stock data per year.

## Method
For this dataset, VBA scripts were written and executed to determine, for each year, the following: total volume per stock, yearly change, and percent change. The stock with the highest total stock volume, the stock with the greatest percent decrease, and the stock with the greatest percent increase were also indicated.

The following equations were used to calculate some of the variables:

          yearly change = value of stock at year close - value of stock at year open
          percent change = (yearly change / value of stock at year open) * 100

Screenshots of the results per year (.png) and the VBA scripts used (.docx) for the easy- (basic), and the moderate- and hard- (moderate-difficult) homework are included.
